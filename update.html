      <h1><strong>Arjen Robben:</strong>how Holland will miss the wonderful master of cutting inside</h1>
      <h4>The winger could be annoying at times with his tendency to fall over too easily but after 14 years of playing for the Oranje he will be remembered for what he is: a simply outstanding football</h4>

      <p><em>Fourteen years is a long time.</em> The Man of Glass lasted the longest â€“ Arjen Robben probably summed it up best himself. After an international career with 37 goals in 96 matches for Holland <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/10/portugal-switzerland-france-holland-world-cup">the 33-year-old bade farewell to the Oranje on Tuesday night.</a> Early on in his career, he had been mocked for being injured too often but in the end there was just a sense of loss.</p>
      <p>The Dutch had not only failed to qualify for the World Cup finals in Russia next summer, they also have to try to regroup now without the one outstanding player they have had at their disposal. Make no mistake, Robben is an extraordinary player and, as with so many others, perhaps he will only be fully appreciated now that he has left.</p>
      <p>It was an overwhelmingly emotional evening at the Amsterdam Arena, where the former Amsterdam mayor Eberhard van der Laan, who died last week, was mourned and the Dutch knew what was coming. Realistically, there was no way they were going to beat Sweden by the seven goals required to reach Russia. As the Wilhelmus anthem reverberated around the stadium, Robben visibly welled up, aware that this was likely to be the final game for his country.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A graph of soaring highs and dispiriting lows, Robbens <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland">Holland</a> career had come full circle in that he made his debut in 2003 and was playing his final game in 2017 under the same coach, Dick Advocaat.</li>
        <li>Advocaats association with Robben is perhaps known most for what many in the Netherlands consider to be the single worst substitution ever.</li>
        <li>Yes</li>
        <li>At <em>Euro 2004</em> Robben, then still only 20 and soon to be heading to Chelsea, started against the Czech Republic and began exerting the influence he would continue to show with the national team for 13 years.</li>
        <li>The Dutch were leading 2-0 and he had dazzled, creating both goals, the first a free-kick deliciously served up with that left foot to the back-post for Wilfried Bouma, and then a cross whipped in from the left for Ruud van Nistelrooy to tap in.</li>
      </ul>
